; mptst_word.s - translation of 16-bit *C* aritmetic to assembly
; **************************************************************
; This file demonstrates translating the following *C* program to assembly:
;
; .. code-block:: c
;    :linenos:
;
;    uint16_t u16_i;
;    uint16_t u16_j;
;    uint16_t u16_k;
;
;    void main(void) {
;      u16_i = 2047;           // u16_i = 2047 (0x7FF).
;      u16_i = u16_i + 1;      // u16_i++, so u16_i = 2048 (0x800).
;      u16_j = u16_i;          // u16_j is 2048 (0x0800).
;      u16_j = u16_j - 1;      // u16_j--, so u16_j is 2047.
;      u16_k = u16_j + u16_i;  // u16_k = 4095 (0x0FFF).
;    }
;
; Declare variables
; =================
; First, set aside space for some variables to work with. The ``.bss`` command instructs the assembler to place the following values in data memory. Data memory starts at 0x1000; locations 0x000-0x0FFF are reserved for special function registers (SFRs).
.bss
; Reserve two bytes (16 bits) for each variable using the ``.space`` directive. To emphasize the connection between assembly and *C*, the equivalent *C* code given above is repeated before its assembly-language translation.

; uint8_t u8_i;
u8_i:   .space 1

; uint8_t u8_j;
u8_j:	.space 1
	
; uint8_t u8_k;
u8_k:   .space 1
   
; uint8_t u8_l;
u8_l:	.space 1

; uint8_t u8_m;
u8_m:	.space 1
 
; This isn't used, but makes the MPLAB X v. 1.80 watch window display the size of the ``u16_k`` variable above correctly.
u16_bug: .space 2

; Code
; ====
; Now, we can write code. First, tell the assembly the following lines should be placed in program memory using the ``.text`` directive.
.text
; Next, label the beginning of our program. Make the label global (visible outside this file), so the PIC24 can run this after powering up.
.global __reset
__reset:
; Our code starts here. The *C* program above is listed as a comment before each group of resulting assembly statements. Above each *C* line is a register assignment. After the register assignment comes the input, process, and output steps.

; u8_i = Y1Y0;
    ; Input
mov #14, W0
    ; Ouput
mov.b WREG, u8_i

; u8_j = Y3Y2;
    ; Input
mov #87, W0
    ; Output
mov.b WREG, u8_j


; u8_l = u8_i + u8_j;
    ; Input
add.b u8_i, WREG
    ; Output
mov.b WREG, u8_l

; u8_k = Y5Y4;
    ; Input
mov #37, W0
    ; Output
mov.b WREG, u8_k 

; Loading
mov.b u8_l, WREG
    
; u8_m = u8_k â€“ u8_l;
    ; Input
sub.b u8_k, WREG
    ; Output
mov.b WREG, u8_m
; The code is complete, but the processor doesn't stop. To give it something to do, loop forever.

    goto     done    ;Place holder for last line of executed code
